# Vercel Deployment Fix for Admin Page

## Issue
The admin page at `/myadmin` was not showing on Vercel deployment due to missing client-side routing configuration.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Created `vercel.json` Configuration
Added a `vercel.json` file in the root directory with the following configuration:

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ],
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/myadmin",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Cache-Control",
          "value": "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

This configuration:
- Redirects all routes to `index.html` for client-side routing
- Adds cache control headers for the admin page to prevent caching issues

### 2. Fixed Dashboard Component
Fixed a reference error in `src/pages/Admin/Dashboard.tsx` where `ContentManager` was referenced instead of `ContentManagerProduction`.

## Deployment Steps

1. **Commit the changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix admin page routing for Vercel deployment"
   git push
   ```

2. **Redeploy on Vercel:**
   - The deployment should automatically trigger when you push to your main branch
   - Or manually trigger a new deployment from the Vercel dashboard

3. **Test the admin page:**
   - Navigate to `https://your-domain.vercel.app/myadmin`
   - Use password: `1234`
   - The admin panel should now load properly

## Admin Access Details

- **URL:** `/myadmin`
- **Password:** `1234`
- **Features:**
  - Home Content Management
  - Sessions Management
  - Blogs Management
  - Testimonials Management

## Troubleshooting

If the admin page still doesn't work:

1. **Clear browser cache** and try again
2. **Check Vercel deployment logs** for any build errors
3. **Verify the `vercel.json` file** is in the root directory
4. **Ensure all files are committed and pushed** to the repository

## Additional Notes

- The admin page uses localStorage for authentication
- All admin functionality is client-side only
- No server-side authentication is required
- The admin panel is protected by a simple 4-digit password
